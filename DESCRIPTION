Description: A streamgraph (or "stream graph") is a type of stacked area graph
             which is displaced around a central axis, resulting in a flowing,
             organic shape. Streamgraphs were developed by Lee Byron and popularized
             by their use in a February 2008 New York Times article on movie
             box office revenues. (Wikipedia) The streamgraph package is based on
             the htmlwidget package and uses d3 to render the visualizations.
